. It offers both command-line and web interface options, making it easy to use in various environments.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

You can use Proxy-Checker from the command line to check proxies. Here are some examples:

Read from standard input and output to a file:

* Read from standard input and output to a file:
  ```sh
  cat ~/path/to/proxies/socks4.txt | ./bin/pc cli -o=~/path/to/ok-proxies.txt
  ```
* Check proxies from a file:
  ```sh
  ./bin/pc cli -i=~/path/to/proxies/socks5.csv
  ```
* Default settings (input from stdin and output to stdout):
  ```sh
  ./bin/pc cli -v
  ```

### HTTP Server

#### API

* Proxy-Checker can be run as an HTTP server to support API requests. Hereâ€™s how to start the server:
  ```sh
  ADDRESS=localhost:8082 ./bin/pc serve
  ```
* Once the server is running, you can check proxies using a POST request:
  ```sh
  curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:8082/api/v1/check' -d '["127.0.0.1:1234", "192.168.0.0:321"]'
  ```

#### Web Interface

Proxy-Checker also provides a web interface for checking proxies. Navigate to the running server's address in your web
browser, to see the form.

## Configuration

The proxy-checker reads all its configuration from environment variables. Each configuration parameter should be set as an
environment variable before running.

* Example
  ```sh
  API=https://self.hosted.checker/ip TIMEOUT=2s CONCURRENCY=200 ./bin/pc cli
  ```
